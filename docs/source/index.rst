KnitScript is a domain-specific programming language for writing V-bed knitting machine instructions.
The language is loosely based on conventions from Python 3 but includes support for controlling a knitting machine.
The code is interpreted into knitout which can then be processed into instructions for different types of knitting machines.

ðŸ§¶ Overview
-----------

KnitScript is a domain-specific programming language designed to make knitting machine programming accessible and intuitive.
While traditional knitout requires low-level instruction management, KnitScript provides:

- **High-level abstractions** for common knitting patterns
- **Automatic optimization** of needle operations and carriage passes
- **Python-like syntax** familiar to programmers
- **Multi-sheet support** for complex fabric structures
- **Comprehensive error handling** with detailed diagnostics

The language compiles to standard knitout format, making it compatible with any machine that supports the knitout specification.

"""Functions for managing yarn carriers in the virtual knitting machine.

This module provides utility functions for working with yarn carriers in the virtual knitting machine environment.
It includes functions for retrieving specific carriers by ID and managing the lifecycle of active carriers through cutting operations.
These functions are commonly used in knit script standard library operations and provide essential carrier management capabilities for knitting machine control.

    This function provides access to specific yarn carriers within the machine's carrier system.
     It serves as a convenient interface for accessing carriers by their numeric identifiers, which are commonly used throughout knit script programs for carrier operations.

    Args:
        machine_state (Knitting_Machine): The virtual knitting machine containing the carrier system to access.
        carrier_id (int): The numeric identifier of the carrier to retrieve. Must be within the valid range of available carriers.

        Yarn_Carrier: The Yarn_Carrier object corresponding to the specified carrier ID, containing all carrier state and configuration information.

    Raises:

    This function generates outhook instructions for all currently active carriers in the machine state,

     This operation is commonly used at the end of knitting operations to properly terminate all yarn carriers and ensure clean completion of the knitting process.

    The function automatically identifies all active carriers, creates appropriate outhook instructions for each one,
     executes those instructions to update the machine state, and returns the instruction list for inclusion in knitout output.

    Args:
        machine_state (Knitting_Machine): The virtual knitting machine whose active carriers should be cut and terminated.

    Returns:

        The list will be empty if no carriers were active at the time of the call.

        This function modifies the machine state by executing the outhook instructions. After execution, all previously active carriers will be inactive and properly terminated.

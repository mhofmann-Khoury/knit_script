"""Module containing the Sheet class.

This module provides the Sheet class, which represents a single sheet in a gauged knitting configuration.
A sheet maintains records of loop positions and provides access to needles that belong to the sheet based on the gauge spacing.

The Sheet class is fundamental to multi-sheet knitting operations,
where different parts of the knitting process are organized across multiple virtual sheets that correspond to different needle positions in a gauged pattern.

    The Xfer_Pass_Racking class calculates the appropriate racking value for transfer operations between needle beds.
    It supports both direct across-bed transfers (where needles are directly opposite each other) and offset transfers where needles are shifted by a specified distance in a particular direction.

    Transfer operations require precise racking calculations to ensure that loops are transferred to the correct target needles.
    This class handles the complexity of converting directional distance specifications into the numeric racking values required by the knitting machine.

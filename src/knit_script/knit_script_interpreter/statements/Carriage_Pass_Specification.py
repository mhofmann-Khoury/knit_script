"""Used to manage all instruction sets written for a single carriage pass in a given direction.

This module provides the Carriage_Pass_Specification class, which coordinates the execution of multiple knitting operations that occur during a single pass of the carriage across the needle bed.
It ensures proper sequencing, compatibility checking, and execution of operations while handling complex scenarios like all-needle operations and drop pass separation.

    This class coordinates the execution of multiple knitting operations that occur during a single pass of the carriage across the needle bed,

        _target_bed (Machine_Bed_Position | None): Target bed filter for operations.
        _has_drops (bool): True if this pass contains drop operations.

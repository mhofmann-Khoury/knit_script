It wraps assignment operations with scope-specific behavior for both local and global variable declarations.

    This statement wraps an assignment operation and can optionally declare the variable in the global scope rather than the current local scope.
    It provides explicit variable declaration semantics that can override the normal scoping rules when global declaration is specified.

    Variable declarations are used to establish new variables with specific scope targeting,

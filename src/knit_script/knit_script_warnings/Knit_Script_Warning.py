"""A module containing the base class for Knitting Script warnings.

This module provides the base warning class and specific warning types for the KnitScript programming language.
These warnings alert developers to potentially problematic code patterns, configuration issues, and situations that may lead to unexpected behavior without causing program termination.
The warning system helps developers write more robust knit script programs by identifying common pitfalls and questionable practices during execution.

    The Knit_Script_Warning class serves as the foundation for all warning types in the KnitScript programming language.

    All specific KnitScript warning types inherit from this class, creating a hierarchical warning system that allows for both specific and general warning handling patterns.

"""This module contains Knit Script Exceptions related to the gauge and sheet management system.

These exceptions are raised when the code reaches an error state caused by mismanagement of gauge and sheet configurations in multi-sheet knitting operations.
The exceptions provide detailed information about gauge limits, sheet boundaries, and complex sheet peeling operations that are essential for advanced knitting techniques.
